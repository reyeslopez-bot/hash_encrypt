# Hash Encrypt Project

This Python project provides robust tools for both hashing passwords using the Argon2 algorithm and symmetric encryption/decryption using Fernet. It's designed for secure data handling, making use of best cryptographic practices.

## Features

- **Secure Hashing**: Utilizes Argon2, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition, recommended for new applications that need to hash passwords securely.
- **Symmetric Encryption and Decryption**: Provides tools for encrypting and decrypting both messages and files using Fernet, which ensures data security and integrity.
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Allows custom settings for cryptographic parameters through a configuration file.
- **Detailed Logging**: Captures operational logs to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.6 or later to run these scripts. All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

1. **Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Modify the config/hash_encrypt.ini configuration file to set the hashing parameters such as memory cost, parallelism, and the number of iterations.

Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

ini
Copy code
[ARGON2]
memory_cost = 65536
iterations = 2
parallelism = 2
Usage
Hashing with hash.py
bash
Copy code
python src/hash.py "YourPasswordHere"
If no argument is provided, the script will prompt you interactively:

bash
Copy code
python src/hash.py
Enter password to hash:
Encrypting and Decrypting with encrypt.py
Encrypting Messages
bash
Copy code
python src/encrypt.py --encrypt "YourMessageHere"
Decrypting Messages
bash
Copy code
python src/encrypt.py --decrypt "EncryptedMessageHere"
Encrypting Files
bash
Copy code
python src/encrypt.py --encrypt-file "/path/to/your/file"
Decrypting Files
bash
Copy code
python src/encrypt.py --decrypt-file "/path/to/your/encrypted/file.enc"
Logging
Logs are written to logs/encryption.log and logs/hashing.log, detailing operations and errors.
