# Hash Encrypt Project

This Python script, `hash_encrypt.py`, provides functionality to generate a salted and peppered hash using the Argon2 hashing algorithm. It's designed for secure password hashing and validation, making use of robust cryptographic practices.

## Features

- **Secure Hashing**: Utilizes Argon2, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition, which is recommended for new applications.
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Allows custom settings for hashing parameters through a configuration file.
- **Detailed Logging**: Captures detailed operational logs to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.6 or later to run this script. The project dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

<!-- 1. **Clone the repository (optional):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.com
   cd hash-encrypt-project
   ``` -->

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

Modify the `hash_encrypt.ini` configuration file to set the hashing parameters such as memory cost, parallelism, and the number of iterations. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```ini
[ARGON2]
memory_cost = 65536
iterations = 2
parallelism = 2
```

### Usage

Run the script from the command line, optionally passing an input string:

```bash
python hash_encrypt.py "YourPasswordHere"
```

For interactive input (if no argument is given), the script will prompt for the input string to hash.

### Logging

Logs are written to `hashing.log` in the current directory, detailing the operations and any errors encountered.
